# Hello-world

Hello, and welcome to my first repository!

The main purpose of this repository is to store all of my repl.it code.

Note: the code stored inside the 'main(4).py' file has recently been acting really strange. Whenever I attempt to test the code out, it works fine until I try using the "how the grinch stole christmas" code, which, for some reason, makes the program answer back with the reply that I programmed for the "elf" code. I have also tried changing it from "how the grinch stole christmas" to quite a few different options, but for some weird reason, it just continues to act up. Feel free to test it out yourselves, though, as it might just be a problem with my laptop or something. Also, if anyone has any helpful tips on how to  fix it, I would be incrediibly grateful.
