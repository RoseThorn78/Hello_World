# Hello-world
Hello, I am RoseThorn.

I am currently Vice-Captain of the MBHS Robotics Club, where I have been learning several new and useful skills, along with the rest of my team.
I am still very new to coding/programming, but I hope to become much better, so that I can be more useful to my team, as we currently don't have many coders.

The main languages that I have been learning are Blocks and Python, and I hope to eventually have the ability to contribute to an autonomous programme for one of my team's competition robots.

Our club's 2 FTC (First Tech challenge) teams currently have 2 competition robots, named Jerry Giraffe, and Dinomighty. 
First Tech Challenge is basically a set of robotics  competitons where robotics teams across the world build, program, and drive robots for competitions. 
During these competitions, we have several 2 minute rounds, with 4 teams competing in each round. The teams are split into 2 alliances, and during these rounds, the robots have to perform some tasks to gain points. 
The current (2022-2023) challenge is called PowerPlay.
