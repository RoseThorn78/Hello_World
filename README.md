# hello-world
Hello, I am RoseThorn.

I am currently Vice-Captain of the MBHS Robotics Club, where I have been learning several new and useful skills.
I am still very new to coding/programming, but I hope to become much better, so that I can be more useful to my team, as we currently don't have many coders.

The main languages that I have been learning are Blocks and Python, and I hope to eventually have the ability to contribute to an autonomous programme for one of our competition robots.
