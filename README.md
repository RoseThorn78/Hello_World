# Hello-world
Hello, I am RoseThorn!

I am currently Vice-Captain of the MBHS Robotics Club, where I have been learning several new and useful skills, along with the rest of my team.
I am still very new to coding/programming, but I hope to become much better, so that I can be more useful to my team, as we currently don't have many coders.

The main languages that I have been learning are Blocks and Python, and I hope to eventually have the ability to contribute to an autonomous programme for one of my team's competition robots.

Our club's 2 FTC (First Tech challenge) teams currently have 2 competition robots, named Jerry Giraffe, and Dinomighty. 
First Tech Challenge is basically a set of robotics  competitons where robotics teams across the world build, program, and drive robots for competitions. 

During these competitions, we have several (2 minute) rounds, split into 2 main categories: a 30 second Autonomous and 90 second Teleop period. Autonomous is when teams use ready-made code/programs to get their robot to complete several tasks to gain points, while during Teleop, teams drive their robots to complete as many tasks as possible. Different tasks earn different amounts of points, and the team with the most points at the end of each match wins. 
There are 4 teams competing in each round, split into 2 randomly selected alliances.

The current (2022-2023) challenge is called PowerPlay.
